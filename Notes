To Commit
created a voting thingy to upvote and downvote
the downvote method doesnt work independently as it deletes a last vote which of no vote exists
only one issue. the damn user can vote more than once. fix that
created a user id for the comment so that now using that id. you can know who commented. only issue now is i have to associate a comment to a post id so as to know which post it belongs to
